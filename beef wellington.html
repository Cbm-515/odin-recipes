    <h3>A traditional british dish</h3>

    This is a show stopping dish. It is a filet mignon encased in individual pockets of flaky, golden brown pastry. This mini beef wellington is the perfect dish for any special occasion. 

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1.75 lbs center cut beef tenderloin</li>
        <li>2 TBsp grapeseed oil</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dijon mustard</li>
        <li>4 ounces prosciutto</li>
        <li>mushroom duxelles</li>
        <li>14 oz. puff pastry</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Sear the beef tenderloin: Add the oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Use paper towel to pat the surface of the beef tenderloin as dry as possible, then season with the kosher salt & ground black pepper. Once the oil is hot & shimmering, add in the beef tenderloin. Cook 2-3 minutes per side until deeply browned. Transfer the seared beef tenderloin to a plate or cutting board & set aside to rest for 20-25 minutes before slicing into 4 individual steaks, roughly 7 ounces each. </li>
        <li>Make the mushroom duxelles: Use paper towel to carefully wipe out the skillet used in Step 1, above, then return to the stove over medium heat, adding the butter. Once melted, add in the chopped mushrooms & shallot. Season with kosher salt & fresh thyme, stirring to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, until all of the water is cooked out of the mixture. Slowly add in the wine, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits that may have formed on the bottom of the skillet. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for an additional 10-15 minutes more, until all of the wine is cooked out of the mixture. Remove from the heat & set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Individual Beef Wellington assembly: Gather the remaining ingredients & assemble the mini Beef Wellington</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup, then arrange the chilled Beef Wellington over top. Generously brush egg wash over the surface of each individual Beef Wellington, then finish with a generous sprinkling of coarse sea salt, as desired. </li>
        <li>Bake the individual Beef Wellington for 25-35 minutes, until the puff pastry is golden brown & the steak has reached your preferred doneness. The best way to measure doneness is to probe an instant-read thermometer into the side of the Beef Wellington. Look for an internal temperature of 120 degrees for rare, 130 degrees for medium-rare, 140 degrees for medium, & so on. Remove from the oven & set aside to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving, the internal temperature will continue to rise to the final temperature as the Beef Wellington rest.</li>
        <li>Serve the individual Beef Wellington with desired side dishes, mashed potatoes, crispy mushrooms, etc. Enjoy!</li>
